# VitalLink backend

**Status: design only, nothing built yet.** This folder holds the plan for the VitalLink API. It has the
design docs and the planned folder layout, with a short description in each module folder. Code gets
written after the owner signs off on the decisions in [docs/10-open-decisions.md](docs/10-open-decisions.md).

The plan builds on the reviewed design doc
["VitalLink Backend System Design"](https://claude.ai/code/artifact/d83166e0-f781-45e9-80e8-d0f399be60cf)
(30 Sep 2026) and adds the domains that the finished frontend needs.

## In one paragraph

VitalLink is a free health and fitness app for people in the Dallas area. It has two clients: the
Expo mobile app (`apps/mobile`) and the React web portal (`apps/web`). Both talk to **one FastAPI
service** (a modular monolith) hosted on **Render's free tier**. The service stores everything in a
private schema in **Supabase Postgres**. **Supabase Auth** handles sign-in and **Supabase Storage**
holds uploaded documents. The phone syncs data from Apple HealthKit and Android Health Connect.
Every user is a consumer who owns their data. Data leaves an account only through a **share** that
the owner creates, which is read-only, time-boxed and revocable. A **consent engine** checks every
such read and writes an entry to an **append-only audit log**. There is no hospital, clinic,
provider or admin interface anywhere.

## Reading order

| # | Doc | What's in it |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | [Introduction](docs/01-introduction.md) | Purpose, users, scope, hard constraints, requirements |
| 2 | [Architecture](docs/02-architecture.md) | System diagram, layers, the 10 modules and what each owns |
| 3 | [Class diagram](docs/03-class-diagram.md) | Domain model and service-layer classes (UML, Mermaid) |
| 4 | [Database](docs/04-database.md) | ER diagrams, every table with its constraints, indexes, deletion rules |
| 5 | [API](docs/05-api.md) | Conventions and the endpoint catalogue, mapped to `packages/api` client calls |
| 6 | [Security & consent](docs/06-security-and-consent.md) | Consent rules, Supabase lockdown, threats, privacy commitments |
| 7 | [Key flows](docs/07-flows.md) | Sequence diagrams: sign-in, sync, sharing, upload, doses, nightly job |
| 8 | [Operations & testing](docs/08-operations-and-testing.md) | Environments, CI/CD, jobs, observability, capacity, backups, tests |
| 9 | [Build plan](docs/09-build-plan.md) | Phased steps with exit criteria and which screens go live in each |
| 10 | [Open decisions](docs/10-open-decisions.md) | Choices the owner must make before or during the build |

Diagrams are Mermaid, so GitHub and VS Code render them inline.

## Stack (all free tier)

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| Language / framework | Python 3.12, FastAPI, Pydantic v2 |
| Database access | SQLAlchemy 2 (async) + asyncpg, Alembic migrations |
| Database | Supabase Postgres (us-east-1), private `vitallink` schema, session pooler :5432 |
| Auth | Supabase Auth (email confirmation on, optional MFA); API verifies JWTs via JWKS |
| Files | Supabase Storage, one private bucket, 5-minute signed URLs |
| Hosting | Render free web service (Virginia), one Docker image |
| Scheduled work | GitHub Actions cron → `POST /internal/jobs/nightly` |
| Analysis | NumPy / SciPy (correlations, trends) in the nightly job only |
| Tests | pytest + httpx against a real Postgres (Docker locally, service container in CI) |

```

Each folder under `app/` that exists today contains a `README.md` that describes its job. The Python
files arrive in the build phases.

## Rules that never bend

- **Consumers only.** No route, table, enum or role for hospitals, clinics, providers or admins.
  A guardrail test fails the build if one appears.
- **No blood features.** No blood type, donors or blood banks. Blood *pressure*, glucose and oxygen
  are ordinary vitals. Lab entry rejects blood-group analytes, so a blood type can't get in that way.
- **Everything free.** Free tiers only, with no card on file.
- **The API is the only door.** No client reads Postgres directly. Every cross-user read goes through
  the consent engine and gets an audit entry, whether it's allowed or refused.
