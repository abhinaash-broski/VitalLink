# VitalLink — context for Claude Code

Group capstone (Kathmandu University, Group 2: Amrit Gautam, Dinesh Chaudhary, Shreenibash Shrestha,
Sudip Ghorasaini; owner Abhinaash). Consumer health & fitness app for the Dallas area: mobile app + web portal.
Owner prefers concise, direct, actionable answers.

## Hard constraints (never break)
- **Consumers only.** No hospital/clinic/provider interface of any kind.
- **No blood features anywhere** (no blood type, donors, blood banks). Blood *pressure*/glucose/oxygen vitals are fine.
- **Everything free** (free tiers only: Supabase free, Render free, GitHub Actions, Expo).
- Design source of truth is Figma; don't invent UI that isn't in the file without asking.

## Repo layout (npm workspaces)
```
packages/tokens  figma-variables.json → build.mjs → css/tokens.css (web, --vl-* vars, .vl-<style> classes)
                                                  + src/generated.ts (colors.light/dark, space, radius, text, elevation)
packages/assets  icons/*.svg (stroke="currentColor", one file per shape+size, e.g. health-18), emergency-qr.json
packages/api     types.ts, client.ts (VitalLinkClient; no baseUrl = mock mode), mock.ts + mock-data/*.ts (Figma
                 sample data), format.ts, screens.ts (dashboard/activity/privacy) and views/*.ts (fitness, care,
                 records, health) → loadX(api) view-models with display strings, web + mobile variants
apps/web         React 19 + Vite 5 + React Router 6 + CSS modules + vite-plugin-svgr (?react imports)
                 components/kit.tsx = shared page parts (PageHeader, PillTabs, StatCard, Panel, BarRow, Split…)
apps/mobile      Expo SDK 57 + Expo Router + react-native-svg + react-native-svg-transformer + @expo-google-fonts
                 src/components/kit.tsx = shared parts (Screen, ChipRow, StatGrid, Section, Row, MenuRow, Pill…)
scripts/         write-icons.py (icons + both Icon registries), icon-masters.json, shoot.py, spa_serve.py
```

## Commands
```
npm install                 # from repo root only (never inside apps/*)
npm run web                 # :5173  every sidebar route, /health/*, /records/*, /welcome, /create-account
npm run mobile              # Expo; `w` for browser
npm run web:build && npm run typecheck
npm run tokens              # after editing figma-variables.json
cd apps/mobile && npx expo export --platform web --output-dir dist   # mobile web build for screenshots
python3 scripts/shoot.py <base-url> <outdir> <w> <h> /path:name ...   # 1440x1024 web, 390x844 mobile
```
`npx expo install` needs network to api.expo.dev; if blocked use `EXPO_OFFLINE=1`.
Env: `VITE_API_URL` (web), `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` (mobile). Unset = mock data.

## Conventions
- No raw colours/sizes/fonts in components: web uses `var(--vl-*)` / `tokenVar(token)` / `.vl-<text-style>`;
  mobile uses `c[token]` and `t("textStyle", colorToken)` from `apps/mobile/src/theme.ts`
  (maps weights to Inter_400Regular/500Medium/600SemiBold/700Bold, RobotoMono_400Regular).
- Icons: never redraw. `scripts/icon-masters.json` holds every `Icon / *` component's paths (24px) exactly as
  Figma exports them; a size is the same geometry with the stroke widened to stay 1.9px on screen. To use a
  new name/size add it to `USES` in `scripts/write-icons.py` and run it — it writes the SVGs and regenerates
  `apps/*/src/components/icons.gen.ts`. New Figma icon → re-export the masters first. Python on Windows: set
  `PYTHONUTF8=1` (the default codec is cp1252) and write files with `newline="\n"`.
- Screens do no formatting; add fields to view-models in `packages/api/src/views/*.ts` (or screens.ts).
  Data with no API endpoint yet goes through `client.pending()` + `need()`: mock mode serves sample data,
  live mode throws `NotAvailableError` so the screen says "isn't available yet" instead of fake numbers.
- Tabs/chips with no Figma frame show a "… is in a later batch" placeholder rather than invented UI.
- Theme: `apps/web/src/theme.ts` sets `<html data-theme>` (Settings › Appearance); `.vl-light/.vl-dark`
  pin a subtree to one mode (theme previews).
- Charts are drawn from data with tokens (not exported images).
- Verify every screen: render with Playwright, compare against the Figma screenshot, fix spacing/type.
  Read text styles from Figma (`textStyleId` names like Heading/H5, Body/Small Strong) rather than guessing.

## Figma
File key `JuPJkw5r1aAtdgRQk2UuaA`. Load the figma-design-to-code skill before `get_design_context`
and figma-use before `use_figma`. `get_metadata` without node lists only the cover page; use `use_figma` to list pages.
Figma asset URLs (www.figma.com) may be blocked by the proxy → use `get_screenshot` with base64, or plugin export.

Every screen file starts with a comment naming its Figma frame (e.g. `// Workouts — Desktop 1440 (Figma 129:1142)`).
Pages: 4:3 mobile auth · 4:4 mobile health · 4:5 mobile fitness · 4:6 mobile records · 149:2 mobile care ·
4:8 mobile profile · 4:10 public site · 4:11 web auth · 4:12 portal (care + My Health tabs) · 4:13 dashboard ·
4:14 web fitness · 4:15 web records. Icon components live on 2:298.

Web shell: sidebar 260, top bar 64, content px32 pt28 gap24. Mobile: header px16 py14, tab bar 72
(Home, Health, Train, Records, Profile). Health and Train are stacks (chips switch screens); care screens
(Medications … Settings, Privacy) live under Profile with a back button; Nutrition/Goals live under Train.

## Status
Done (Oct 2026, every frame in the Figma file, compared against Figma screenshots): web portal (all 16 sidebar
items, 9 My Health tabs, Lab Results, Document Viewer, Create Account, public homepage at /welcome) and mobile
(Welcome, Create Account, Health Overview/Activity/Digital, Workouts, Nutrition, Goals, Records, Profile and
the 10 Profile screens). Mock data drives everything. Sign-in/sign-up are stubs (real auth = Supabase Auth).
**Next:** owner reviews → decide the open issues below → wire to the real backend.

## Open issues flagged to the owner (awaiting decisions)
- Desktop Privacy shows "Hospitals with access" + hospital rows — conflicts with consumers-only. Built as
  designed; `grantee_kind: "hospital"` is design-only (API never returns it). Likely to remove.
- "HIPAA-aligned" sign-in copy is misleading for a non-HIPAA consumer app.
- Sign-in brand panel body text (textSecondary on inverse) has low contrast.
- Figma leftovers from blood era: variables text/blood, border/blood, bg/blood-subtle, urgency/emergency-bg,
  donor-eligible, donor-deferred (mapped to neutral tokens in code); component descriptions mention blood.
- Design data inconsistencies, code computes from data: steps total 60,912 / avg 8,702 (Figma 58,904 / 8,415);
  goal days 2/7 (Figma 3/7); dashboard "daily goal 8,000" vs 10,000 used; mobile "Active shares 2 · links & family"
  → "7 · doctors & family" (share links were removed in backend review).
- Desktop steps chart: Figma's in-plot "Goal 10,000" label collides with Monday's value → moved to a key below.
- BP chart uses a true 40–170 mmHg scale, so lines are flatter than the hand-drawn Figma ones.
- (Fixed) mobile 18px bike/run icons are now generated from the 24px masters, not scaled 20px exports.
- Public homepage (99:2): left out "For Providers" nav, "For organisations" footer column, "HIPAA-aligned"
  security card, and the whole testimonials section (two quotes are blood-bank leftovers — "four units of
  O-negative", "inventory… log units" — and all three are unverified endorsements). Duplicate "Training Plans"
  footer link shown once; only the first FAQ has answer copy, the rest are plain rows.
- More blood-era Figma layer names (visible content is fine): "North Texas Blood Center", "Avatar/Tone=Blood",
  "Notif / Blood match found near you", "Stat / Blood group", "Cat / Blood", "Article / Who can donate…",
  "Article / Iron-rich foods…", "Article / Controlling heavy bleeding", "Step / Blood Information",
  "Find Blood Now" (CTA button).
- Document Viewer "Sharing permissions" showed "Link · expires" and "Anyone with the link"; share links were
  removed, so it shows the named share with its expiry and drops the anonymous-link row.
- Mobile has no entry point for Nutrition/Goals (frames show the Train tab) → added rows to Profile ›
  "Health & records". Mobile Sleep/Heart/Body chips have no frames → placeholder. Mobile record rows have
  chevrons but no detail frame.
- Values computed from mock data differ from some Figma copy: Goals "across 6 areas" (Figma 4) and the
  consistency caption (26 of 35, Sundays weakest; Figma 27, Thursdays); Appointments "3 upcoming · next visit
  Tue 15 Sep" (Figma "2 upcoming · tomorrow"; 15 Sep 2026 is a Tuesday and today is Sun 13 Sep); Nutrition
  date "Sunday, 13 September" (Figma Saturday 19); Devices last sync "3 minutes" (Figma 12); Mental "6 of 7
  days logged" (Figma 5); notifications show the same 7 items on web and mobile (the frames showed 6 and 5).
- Copy written for data (no Figma text): the Family note uses "their own privacy centre" (Figma "her"),
  Create Account "Entries don't match yet." helper, mobile Emergency "Show QR" reveals the web QR card.
- Workouts/Records use km (as in Figma) while Activity uses miles — units should follow Settings › Units.

## Backend (designed, not built here)
Doc: "VitalLink Backend System Design" https://claude.ai/code/artifact/d83166e0-f781-45e9-80e8-d0f399be60cf
- Python 3.12 + FastAPI modular monolith on Render free (Virginia).
- Supabase (us-east-1): Postgres in private `vitallink` schema, Data API off, deny-all RLS, connect via session
  pooler :5432; Supabase Auth with email confirmation; private Storage bucket.
- Nightly job via GitHub Actions cron (synchronous, per-user transactions).
- Consent engine: pure `decide()` + append-only durable audit log (own transaction, trigger blocks updates).
- Readings upserted as 5-minute aggregates. Health data from Health Connect (Android) / HealthKit (iOS);
  Google Fit APIs end late 2026 — don't use them.
- Compliance: FTC Health Breach Notification Rule (not HIPAA).
- API paths the client expects: `/v1/me`, `/me/dashboard`, series, blood pressure, workouts, goals,
  `/me/medications/today`, shares, access log. Not in API yet (mock-only, `null` live → "isn't available
  yet"): latest BP, streaks, next appointment, latest lab, privacy settings, and everything behind the new
  screens — training, nutrition, goals overview, prescriptions, appointments, conversations, notifications,
  family, emergency profile, devices, library, account, records + lab panels, and the My Health tabs.
  Their shapes are in `packages/api/src/types.ts` (one interface per endpoint) for the backend to match.
